# 🚀 FNG Loan & Contribution App - Deploy Now

## ⚡ FASTEST DEPLOYMENT (30 Seconds)

### Option 1: Use the Deploy Script ⭐ EASIEST

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
deploy.bat
```

**That's it! The script does everything automatically.** ✅

---

### Option 2: Manual Commands (3 commands)

**Copy-paste these one by one:**

```bash
# 1. Fix _redirects
rm -rf public/_redirects && echo "/* /index.html 200" > public/_redirects

# 2. Commit
git add . && git commit -m "Deploy"

# 3. Push
git push
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **00:30** - Push complete
- **01:00** - Netlify starts building
- **03:00** - ✅ **SITE IS LIVE!**

---

## 🎯 What I Just Fixed

✅ Deleted `/public/_redirects/Code-component-174-9.tsx`  
✅ Deleted `/public/_redirects/Code-component-174-24.tsx`  
✅ Created proper `/public/_redirects` FILE  
✅ Added content: `/* /index.html 200`

**Your project is NOW ready to deploy!**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Why This Happens

**Figma Make Bug:**
- Every download creates `_redirects` as a **DIRECTORY**
- This causes Netlify build to fail
- You MUST fix it before every deployment

**The Fix:**
- Run the deploy script (or manual command #1)
- This deletes the directory and creates a proper file
- Takes 5 seconds

## 🔄 Your Deployment Workflow

**EVERY TIME you deploy:**
