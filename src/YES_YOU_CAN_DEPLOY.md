## 🔧 Why This Bug Keeps Happening

**Figma Make Bug:**
- When you download/export from Figma Make, it incorrectly creates `/public/_redirects/` as a DIRECTORY
- Inside that directory, it puts React components (`.tsx` files)
- This is WRONG - it should be a simple text FILE

**Why It Breaks Builds:**
- Vite (your build tool) tries to compile ALL `.tsx` files
- Those files in `_redirects` directory have invalid code
- Build fails

**The Solution:**
- **Use Vercel** - doesn't need `_redirects` at all! ✅
- **Or fix on your computer** - delete directory, create file
- **Never try to fix in Figma Make** - it will recreate the bug

---

## ✅ WHAT I JUST FIXED (AGAIN)

I just:
1. ✅ Deleted `Code-component-178-8.tsx`
2. ✅ Deleted `Code-component-178-21.tsx`  
3. ✅ Created proper `_redirects` FILE (not directory)

**But this won't help you deploy from Figma Make!**

**You need to either:**
- **Deploy to Vercel** (easiest - bug doesn't matter!)
- **Fix on your computer** before pushing to GitHub
