# 💰 Bulk Contribution Mode - Complete Guide

## Overview

The Bulk Contribution Mode is a powerful feature that automatically distributes a lump sum amount across multiple consecutive days on your calendar. Instead of manually contributing to each day, enter the total amount once and let the system mark all the days for you!

---

## 🎯 What It Does

### Basic Concept

**Traditional Method:**
- Day 1: Contribute ₦500
- Day 2: Contribute ₦500
- Day 3: Contribute ₦500
- ... repeat 10 times
- **Total:** 10 separate transactions

**Bulk Contribution Method:**
- One time: Contribute ₦5,000
- System automatically marks Days 1-10
- **Total:** 1 transaction = 10 days covered! 🎉

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 3 Simple Steps:

1. **Toggle Bulk Mode ON**
   - See the switch at top of contribution form
   - Label: "Bulk Contribution Mode"

2. **Enter Lump Sum**
   - Type amount (e.g., ₦5,000)
   - See preview: "= 10 days × ₦500"
   - Calendar shows purple indicators

3. **Confirm & Pay**
   - Click "Contribute" button
   - Review confirmation dialog
   - Complete payment
   - All days marked automatically!

---

## 📐 How It Calculates

### Simple Division

```
Days Covered = Lump Sum Amount ÷ Daily Target

Example 1:
₦5,000 ÷ ₦500 = 10 days
Result: 10 days × ₦500 each

Example 2:
₦15,000 ÷ ₦1,000 = 15 days
Result: 15 days × ₦1,000 each

Example 3:
₦100,000 ÷ ₦2,000 = 50 days
Result: 50 days × ₦2,000 each
```

### With Remainders

When the division isn't perfect:

```
Example:
₦5,750 ÷ ₦500 = 11 days + ₦250 remainder

Result:
- Days 1-11: ₦500 each (target met - green)
- Day 12: ₦250 (partial - blue)
- Total: 12 days marked
```

---

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### Calendar Colors

**Purple with Border (Preview):**
- Shows which days will be marked
- Only visible in bulk mode before payment
- Helps you visualize the distribution

**Green with Border (After Payment):**
- Days where amount = daily target
- Target achievement confirmed
- Full contribution recorded

**Blue (Remainder Day):**
- Last day if there's a remainder
- Amount less than daily target
- Still counts toward total savings

---

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Calculation Formula

```javascript
const numberOfDays = Math.floor(amount / dailyTarget);
const remainder = amount % dailyTarget;
const totalDays = numberOfDays + (remainder > 0 ? 1 : 0);
```

### Distribution Logic

```javascript
// For each full day
for (let i = 0; i < numberOfDays; i++) {
  const date = startDate + i days;
  contribute(date, dailyTarget);
}

// For remainder day (if exists)
if (remainder > 0) {
  const finalDate = startDate + numberOfDays days;
  contribute(finalDate, remainder);
}
```

### Transaction Recording

**Single Transaction:**
- ID: Timestamp
- Type: "contribution"
- Amount: Full lump sum
- Date: Starting date
- Description: "Bulk Contribution (X days)"
- Status: "completed"

**Multiple Calendar Entries:**
- Each day gets individual contribution record
- All timestamped at same time
- Linked to single payment
- Each day independently tracked
